# codehub-project
This is the Code Hub Discord server group project. Everyone is welcome to contribute, even if you're just learning!

The project is built on top of the [Allegro 5](https://github.com/liballeg/allegro5) library. If you're on Linux, you'll need to compile the library yourself. For inexperienced users, you can run `scripts/allegro_installer.sh` to do it for you.

[Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile) is used to compile the project. All you need to do is navigate to the repository's root directory and run `make`. The resulting executable will be located in the `bin` directory.
